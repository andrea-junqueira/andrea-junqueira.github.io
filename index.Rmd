<div style="padding-left:300px">

I am currently a Ph.D candidate in the Department of Political Science at Texas A\&M University. 

My research interests focus on the intersection between economic development, representation, and comparative public policy. 

In my dissertation, I investigate how poverty and income inequality affect democratic politics, focusing on their consequences for security policy.
