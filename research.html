Abstract
</button>
<div id="BlockName20" class="collapse">
<p>There is a consensus that electoral institutions affect how well
legislatures descriptively represent their citizens. Most research to
date, however, assumes that institutions affect members of different
groups in the same way. In this book project, we draw on intersectional
theories, which recognize gender and racial identities as mutually
constitutive and interconnected, and contend that institutions have
disparate effects on individuals holding different combinations of
gender and racial identities. Our argument focuses primarily on district
magnitude, which, when increased, leads aspiring politicians, party
leaders, and voters to act in very different ways. Using a massive
dataset with information on three different Brazilian elections and more
than 1.2 million candidates, we estimate the causal impact of district
magnitude on the emergence and electoral success of candidates with
different gender and racial identities, both independently as well as
interactively. We show that district magnitude has a positive effect on
the emergence of candidates from historically underrepresented groups,
but the size of the effect varies across groups. Moreover, we show that
more diverse candidate fields do not translate into more diverse
legislatures. In Brazil, as district magnitude increases, elected
legislatures become less representative of women (whites and
Afro-Brazilians) because competition increases and their access to
campaign resources declines. These results demonstrate that electoral
institutions have disparate effects on individuals with different
combinations of race-gender identities.</p>

<p>How do race and gender together shape Americans’ political ambition?
Using original survey data with over-samples of Black and Hispanic
respondents, we analyze citizens’ nascent ambition for eight political
offices across racial/ethnic groups and gender. We reveal that the
primary gap in nascent political ambition is not between men and women
but between white men and the majority of the polity. There is no
consistent gender gap in ambition among Black or Hispanic respondents,
nor between Black and Hispanic men and white women. The gap between
white men and other respondents is most pronounced for local offices,
which mark both the starting point and final stage of many political
careers. Our findings further indicate that while white men are
particularly responsive to encouragement from non-political sources,
ambition gaps narrow among respondents encouraged by political actors.
Together, these insights help explain the persistence of white men’s
overrepresentation in U.S. politics.</p>

<p>Does the election of politicians from historically marginalized
groups spur others to enter politics? Some political scientists and
policymakers posit that the election of women and people of color to
prominent political offices can inspire others to run for office, yet
prior research has yielded mixed results. We contribute to the
literature on representation by exploring the impact of role models on
candidate emergence at the local level, where aspiring politicians
typically begin to climb the political ladder. Using data from Brazilian
elections and a set of regression discontinuity designs, we find no
evidence that the election of a woman or Afro-Brazilian mayor spurs
women and Afro-Brazilians to run for city council positions. Our
results, which are robust to several alternative specifications, suggest
that even if the election of a woman or minority politician inspires
others to enter politics, barriers may impede them from running for
office.</p>

<p>The ability of voters to accurately perceive the ideological
positions of political parties is foundational to the democratic
process. Existing research has demonstrated that in parliamentary
democracies, voters rely on information about coalition status to
navigate the complexities of placing parties on an ideologically
coherent scale. We contribute to this literature by investigating the
role of coalitions as a heuristic tool in presidential democracies. We
argue that the central role of the president in coalition formation and
operation, combined with the higher complexity of party systems, makes
coalition information in these democracies more accessible and
understandable primarily among sophisticated voters. Testing our
hypotheses with data from three presidential democracies, we find, as
expected, that sophisticated voters are more likely than less
sophisticated voters to perceive parties in coalition with the
president’s party as ideologically closer to the party of the
president.</p>

<div id="BlockName2" class="collapse">
<p>The party politics literature suggests that an institutionalized
party system can be key for well-functioning democracies. Do the
benefits of strong parties also extend to women’s descriptive
representation? We argue that increasing parties’ strength can
perpetuate and even intensify parties’ pre-existing patterns of
exclusion of particular groups, including women, when elites are
gender-biased. While stronger parties are better able to carry out their
organizational goals, we contend that increasing gender equity is often
not part of such goals. To evaluate this argument, we combine an
exogenous electoral reform that increased parties’ ability to control
their members in Brazil with a regression discontinuity design. We find
that while the reform increased parties’ ability to pursue their
organizational goals, it increased the gap in votes between men and
women. Further, we demonstrate that the behavior of men towards women
co-partisans drives this pattern. These findings highlight the
unintended consequences of institutional engineering.</p>

<em>Results</em>: Using data on the volatility of support for German

Abstract

<div id="BlockName3" class="collapse">
<p><em>Objective</em>: Politics around the world has become more
divisive. We ask if the influence of far-right parties extends to
personal concerns and argue that a theory combining issue ownership with
partisan discourse can explain personal policy salience.
<em>Method</em>: Using aggregate Eurobarometer data, we create
compositional models to estimate the effect of partisan discourse on
pocketbook policy concerns. We focus on whether these elite messages
influence concerns differently depending on the presence of a far-right
party. <em>Results</em>: We find that more partisan discussion about
law-and-order issues influences relative personal concerns on security
and immigration issues across ideological groups when a far-right party
is present. <em>Conclusions</em>: Our findings suggest that an “issue
owning” party can alter how people interpret politics and view their own
concerns. Far-right parties influence the perceptions of people across
ideologies. Research showed that these parties can influence parties and
voters; we show that they can shape personal perceptions.</p>

strong support for our theoretical expectations on how spatial and

strong support for our expectations on how the percentage of

“Preventing a War of All Against All: Geographic Sorting in OLPR
Electoral Systems.” <em>Under review</em>. </font></p>
<button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#BlockName10" center>
Abstract
</button>
<div id="BlockName10" class="collapse">
<p>In open-list proportional representation (OLPR) systems, candidates
must obtain personal votes to succeed. Conventional wisdom about these
systems is that they induce intraparty competition and, ultimately, weak
political parties. In this paper, we argue that, even under extreme
institutional conditions, parties face incentives to limit competition
among co-partisans. To evaluate this argument, we create the first
measure of intraparty competition to incorporate the spatial
distribution of all votes in the district. Using polling station-level
data in Brazil, we show that about fifty percent of parties coordinate
competition among co-partisans by limiting the number of strong
candidates in the list or selecting candidates whose electoral bases do
not overlap. We also show that electorally strong parties are more prone
to coordination and that coordination leads to electoral success. Our
findings challenge the perception of weak parties in OLPR systems,
highlighting strategic coordination as a prevalent phenomenon even in
permissive electoral environments.</p>

Abstract

<div id="BlockName12" class="collapse">
<p>Recent advances in the analysis of compositional data have extended
the applicability of compositional-outcome models from cross-sectional
data to time series and time-series-cross-section data. These models can
explicitly account for the temporal and spatial dynamics in one’s
theory. While these advances are many, and important, the models
presented thus far assume that regressors are weakly exogenous. In this
letter, we relax the assumption of weak-exogeneity by introducing a
model that accounts for simultaneity between compositional outcomes and
endogenous non-compositional variables in time series data. Our approach
involves creating what we call a compositional vector autoregression
framework. We demonstrate the utility of our modeling approach with an
application that analyzes income inequality in the United States.</p>
