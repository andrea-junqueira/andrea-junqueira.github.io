Abstract
</button>
<div id="BlockName14" class="collapse">
<p>The ability of voters to accurately perceive the ideological
positions of political parties is foundational to the democratic
process. Existing research has demonstrated that in parliamentary
democracies, voters rely on information about coalition status to
navigate the complexities of placing parties on an ideologically
coherent scale. We contribute to this literature by investigating the
role of coalitions as a heuristic tool in presidential democracies. We
argue that the central role of the president in coalition formation and
operation, combined with the higher complexity of party systems, makes
coalition information in these democracies more accessible and
understandable primarily among sophisticated voters. Testing our
hypotheses with data from three presidential democracies, we find, as
expected, that sophisticated voters are more likely than less
sophisticated voters to perceive parties in coalition with the
president’s party as ideologically closer to the party of the
president.</p>

Abstract

<div id="BlockName2" class="collapse">
<p>The party politics literature suggests that an institutionalized
party system can be key for well-functioning democracies. Do the
benefits of strong parties also extend to women’s descriptive
representation? We argue that increasing parties’ strength can
perpetuate and even intensify parties’ pre-existing patterns of
exclusion of particular groups, including women, when elites are
gender-biased. While stronger parties are better able to carry out their
organizational goals, we contend that increasing gender equity is often
not part of such goals. To evaluate this argument, we combine an
exogenous electoral reform that increased parties’ ability to control
their members in Brazil with a regression discontinuity design. We find
that while the reform increased parties’ ability to pursue their
organizational goals, it increased the gap in votes between men and
women. Further, we demonstrate that the behavior of men towards women
co-partisans drives this pattern. These findings highlight the
unintended consequences of institutional engineering.</p>

<div id="BlockName7" class="collapse">
<p>Does the election of politicians from historically marginalized
groups spur others to enter politics? Some political scientists and
policymakers posit that the election of women and people of color to
prominent political offices can inspire others to run for office, yet
prior research has yielded mixed results. We contribute to the
literature on representation by exploring the impact of role models on
candidate emergence at the local level, where aspiring politicians
typically begin to climb the political ladder. Using data from Brazilian
elections and a set of regression discontinuity designs, we find no
evidence that the election of a woman or Afro-Brazilian mayor spurs
women and Afro-Brazilians to run for city council positions. Our
results, which are robust to several alternative specifications, suggest
that even if the election of a woman or minority politician inspires
others to enter politics, barriers may impede them from running for
office.</p>

<p><em>Objective</em>: To demonstrate the utility of modeling
compositional volatility in substantive domains beyond budgeting.
<em>Methods</em>: We show how to model compositional volatility on its

<em>Results</em>: Using data on the volatility of support for German

<p><em>Objective</em>: Politics around the world has become more
divisive. We ask if the influence of far-right parties extends to
personal concerns and argue that a theory combining issue ownership with
partisan discourse can explain personal policy salience.
<em>Method</em>: Using aggregate Eurobarometer data, we create
compositional models to estimate the effect of partisan discourse on
pocketbook policy concerns. We focus on whether these elite messages
influence concerns differently depending on the presence of a far-right
party. <em>Results</em>: We find that more partisan discussion about
law-and-order issues influences relative personal concerns on security
and immigration issues across ideological groups when a far-right party
is present. <em>Conclusions</em>: Our findings suggest that an “issue
owning” party can alter how people interpret politics and view their own
concerns. Far-right parties influence the perceptions of people across
ideologies. Research showed that these parties can influence parties and
voters; we show that they can shape personal perceptions.</p>

strong support for our theoretical expectations on how spatial and

strong support for our expectations on how the percentage of

exogenous variables, we included a linear time trend and a dummy for the

“Preventing a War of All Against All: Geographic Sorting in OLPR
Electoral Systems.” <em>Under review</em>. </font></p>
<button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#BlockName10" center>
Abstract
</button>
<div id="BlockName10" class="collapse">
<p>In open-list proportional representation (OLPR) systems, candidates
must obtain personal votes to succeed. Conventional wisdom about these
systems is that they induce intraparty competition and, ultimately, weak
political parties. In this paper, we argue that, even under extreme
institutional conditions, parties face incentives to limit competition
among co-partisans. To evaluate this argument, we create the first
measure of intraparty competition to incorporate the spatial
distribution of all votes in the district. Using polling station-level
data in Brazil, we show that about fifty percent of parties coordinate
competition among co-partisans by limiting the number of strong
candidates in the list or selecting candidates whose electoral bases do
not overlap. We also show that electorally strong parties are more prone
to coordination and that coordination leads to electoral success. Our
findings challenge the perception of weak parties in OLPR systems,
highlighting strategic coordination as a prevalent phenomenon even in
permissive electoral environments.</p>

Abstract
</button>
<div id="BlockName15" class="collapse">
<p>We offer a comprehensive analysis of nascent political ambition
across racial/ethnic groups and gender. Our original survey data, which
over-samples Black and Hispanic respondents, reveals that the gap in
nascent political ambition is not between men and women, but rather
between white men and the majority of the polity. There is no
significant gender gap in political ambition among Black and Hispanic
respondents, nor between Black and Hispanic men and white women. This
race-gender ambition gap is most present for local offices, where many
politicians start their political careers. Our findings highlight the
importance of encouragement in shaping political ambition. White men are
particularly responsive to encouragement from non-political sources, but
the ambition gaps close when respondents receive encouragement from
political sources. This suggests that political parties can play a
crucial role in remediating the racegender ambition gap by actively
recruiting and encouraging qualified candidates from diverse
backgrounds.</p>

Abstract
</button>
<div id="BlockName5" class="collapse">
<p>In democracies, how can coercive security policies that violate the
rights of many be so pervasive, even when those most affected by their
negative consequences are a large share of the population? I argue that
the explanation can be found by examining voters’ incentives to demand
security vis-a-vis other policies. Among low-income citizens, security
concerns compete with other immediate needs, including food and shelter,
thereby reducing the relative importance of violence as the primary
driver of political demands. In response, strategic politicians become
less responsive to the preferences of the poor on this policy dimension.
With a multi-method research approach, I test the implications of my
theory using a difference-in-differences-in-differences (DDD) design of
electoral results and an original survey experiment with politicians. I
find that low-income voters are less responsive to violence shocks and
that politicians emphasize security concerns less when trying to attract
the vote of low-income citizens relative to the wealthy.</p>

Abstract

<div id="BlockName11" class="collapse">
<p>Rapid urbanization increases the need to produce public goods,
particularly in developing countries, where underprovision and unequal
access to services are common. Many public services and development
projects are tied to specific neighborhoods, where citizens vote at
polling stations whose vote shares are publicly known. We argue that
even in “at large electoral systems,” the local nature of public
services provision creates incentives for voters to demand narrow local
representation and for local politicians to respond to specific requests
and interests of a given group of constituencies within the city, often
at the expense of others. We test our expectations by exploring
variation in sub-municipal service provision in three major cities in
Latin America: Sao Paulo, Bogota, and Fortaleza. Our manuscript focuses
on our empirical findings and the complex challenges facing scholars
studying sub-municipal outcomes in multiple cases. Our results speak to
the difficulties of overcoming underdevelopment and achieving democratic
consolidation in the global south.</p>

“Coalition Governance, Economic Voting, and Costs of Ruling in
Presidential and Parliamentary Regimes.” <em>In progress</em>.
</font></p>
<button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#BlockName9" center>
Abstract
</button>
<div id="BlockName9" class="collapse">
<p>Throughout the democratic world, the modal government is a coalition
of two or more political parties. Such cooperative arrangements between
political rivals create challenges for voters attempting to evaluate
their government’s performance and have motivated extensive literature
on the costs of ruling and economic voting in conditions where clarity
of responsibility for governing outcomes is less than clear. Although
this literature has advanced our understanding of the relevant dynamics
on how voters identify who is responsible for implementing policies and
how they appropriately reward or punish the government for its
performance, the vast majority of what we know about these dynamics
comes from data on parliamentary regimes. In this project, we will
compare these dynamics between presidential and parliamentary regimes.
Presidential democracies are fundamentally different from parliamentary
democracies in that the chief executive is elected separately from the
legislature and serves for a fixed term. These features raise
interesting questions about how voters hold governments accountable,
especially when the government is a coalition. To answer these
questions, we leverage a new collection of data on election results from
presidential and parliamentary regimes that spans over 70 years
(1949-2020), augmented by survey data on voters’ knowledge about
governments in these two regime types.</p>

Abstract

<div id="BlockName12" class="collapse">
<p>Recent advances in the analysis of compositional data have extended
the applicability of compositional-outcome models from cross-sectional
data to time series and time-series-cross-section data. These models can
explicitly account for the temporal and spatial dynamics in one’s
theory. While these advances are many, and important, the models
presented thus far assume that regressors are weakly exogenous. In this
letter, we relax the assumption of weak-exogeneity by introducing a
model that accounts for simultaneity between compositional outcomes and
endogenous non-compositional variables in time series data. Our approach
involves creating what we call a compositional vector autoregression
framework. We demonstrate the utility of our modeling approach with an
application that analyzes income inequality in the United States.</p>
